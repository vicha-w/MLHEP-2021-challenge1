# MLHEP-2021-challenge1
Here lies my code that I unsuccessfully tried and tried over several days,
pushing over the leaderboard with hope that I would break the baseline score,
spent nights and nights in front of my laptop, even during my birthday,
trying everythin I can dream of, even when I am on the bed and can't sleep,
just to see my score fall short like a loser on Kaggle leaderboard.

If you are reading this, thank you for acknowledging my failure.
You can laugh at me. You can say I'm a loser. You can say I'm a failure.
Because that's what I am. A loser. A failure. A fool.
At least for this competition. 
I am tired. :-(
